# GIS 206
GIS 206 is a course taught by Yoh Kawano at UCLA. This class is being offered during Winter 2022, and the objective of the course is to be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

### About Myself:
- My name is Estefany Garcia and I am a Master's of Urban Planning student at UCLA. I am a first year MURP student, with a professional background in community organizing throughout the Eastside of Los Angeles. 

### Project Ideas: 
- How many affordable housing units are there per state throughout the United States? 
- How many informal housing units are there throughout Los Angeles? Are there any existing programs that support informal housing units becoming up to code or incentivize affordable housing development in existing properties? 
- In Los Angeles, how many people experience harrassment by their landlord, how many submit a formal complaint per year, and what is the average resolution after submitting a complaint? 

### My Objectives of the Class:
- Learn how to take large data samples and create tools with GIS that makes information assessible for all regardless of educational background
- Introduce GIS case studies across urban planning concentrations (ex: housing justice, transportation, environmental justice, regional planning, etc.)
